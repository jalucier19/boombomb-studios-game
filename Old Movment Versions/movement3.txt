adventure game movement v0.5
uses a list "movement" that contains your decisions
if there is a choice that must be omitted, remove it from the list
run the function again if there is a bad input

just thought it would add an element of surprise

improvement from older versions:
now using variables to to reduce the amount of
text in the lists, also prevents having to 
keep referencing the same thing (what are variables used for? oh yeah)
